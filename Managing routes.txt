##Creating routes

1.) Configure a new route on the /mock path to direct traffic to the example_service service created earlier:

curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8001/services/example_service/routes \
  --data 'paths[]=/mock' \
  --data name=example_route



2.)Viewing route configuration

The route URL can take either of the following forms:

/services/{service name or id}/routes/{route name or id}
/routes/{route name or id}

To view the current state of the example_route route, make a GET request to the route URL:

curl -X GET http://localhost:8001/services/example_service/routes/example_route


3.)Updating routes
curl --request PATCH \
  --url localhost:8001/services/example_service/routes/example_route \
  --data tags="tutorial"




4.)Listing routes
curl http://localhost:8001/routes
